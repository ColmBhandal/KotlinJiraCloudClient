/**
 * User details permitted by the user's Atlassian Account privacy settings. However, be aware of these exceptions:   *  User record deleted from Atlassian: This occurs as the result of a right to be forgotten request. In this case, `displayName` provides an indication and other parameters have default values or are blank (for example, email is blank).  *  User record corrupted: This occurs as a results of events such as a server import and can only happen to deleted users. In this case, `accountId` returns *unknown* and all other parameters have fallback values.  *  User record unavailable: This usually occurs due to an internal service outage. In this case, all parameters have fallback values.
 * @param self The URL of the user.
 * @param name This property is no longer available and will be removed from the documentation soon. See the [deprecation notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/) for details.
 * @param key This property is no longer available and will be removed from the documentation soon. See the [deprecation notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/) for details.
 * @param accountId The account ID of the user, which uniquely identifies the user across all Atlassian products. For example, *5b10ac8d82e05b22cc7d4ef5*.
 * @param emailAddress The email address of the user. Depending on the user’s privacy settings, this may be returned as null.
 * @param avatarUrls The avatars of the user.
 * @param displayName The display name of the user. Depending on the user’s privacy settings, this may return an alternative value.
 * @param active Whether the user is active.
 * @param timeZone The time zone specified in the user's profile. Depending on the user’s privacy settings, this may be returned as null.
 * @param accountType The type of account represented by this user. This will be one of 'atlassian' (normal users), 'app' (application user) or 'customer' (Jira Service Desk customer user)
