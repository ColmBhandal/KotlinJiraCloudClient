/**
 * Details about a component with a count of the issues it contains.
 * @param issueCount Count of issues for the component.
 * @param description The description for the component.
 * @param self The URL for this count of the issues contained in the component.
 * @param project The key of the project to which the component is assigned.
 * @param lead The user details for the component's lead user.
 * @param assigneeType The nominal user type used to determine the assignee for issues created with this component. See `realAssigneeType` for details on how the type of the user, and hence the user, assigned to issues is determined. Takes the following values:   *  `PROJECT_LEAD` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the project the component is in.  *  `COMPONENT_LEAD` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the component.  *  `UNASSIGNED` an assignee is not set for issues created with this component.  *  `PROJECT_DEFAULT` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the default assignee for the project that the component is in.
 * @param projectId Not used.
 * @param assignee The details of the user associated with `assigneeType`, if any. See `realAssignee` for details of the user assigned to issues created with this component.
 * @param realAssignee The user assigned to issues created with this component, when `assigneeType` does not identify a valid assignee.
 * @param isAssigneeTypeValid Whether a user is associated with `assigneeType`. For example, if the `assigneeType` is set to `COMPONENT_LEAD` but the component lead is not set, then `false` is returned.
 * @param realAssigneeType The type of the assignee that is assigned to issues created with this component, when an assignee cannot be set from the `assigneeType`. For example, `assigneeType` is set to `COMPONENT_LEAD` but no component lead is set. This property is set to one of the following values:   *  `PROJECT_LEAD` when `assigneeType` is `PROJECT_LEAD` and the project lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.  *  `COMPONENT_LEAD` when `assignee`Type is `COMPONENT_LEAD` and the component lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.  *  `UNASSIGNED` when `assigneeType` is `UNASSIGNED` and Jira is configured to allow unassigned issues.  *  `PROJECT_DEFAULT` when none of the preceding cases are true.
 * @param name The name for the component.
 * @param id The unique identifier for the component.
